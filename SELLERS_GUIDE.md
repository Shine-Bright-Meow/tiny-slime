# Selling Tiny-Slimes

If you are reading this, there's a good chance, that you've decided to sell
these modules for others. Because of the licensing I've put on them, I couldn't
stop you even if I wanted to (but to be clear, I don't). However, there are some
things you should probably keep in mind before jumping in head-first and hitting
the bottom of the pool.

## Read the license properly

[The license](./LICENSE) I've included is the MIT software license. It's very
short, make sure to read through it properly and that you understand it, but the
most important details:

- You can freely sell it, modify it, or even redistribute it
- I waive any responsibility in case you decide to use this design, even if a
  problem is because of an issue caused by me
- If you modify the design, the parts that stayed the same must be licensed
  under the same MIT license

## Warnings you should include

Tiny-Slimes have some drawbacks that you should make your buyers aware of.

First and foremost, the antenna included on the Supermini module is way weaker
than that of a D1 Mini or similar microcontroller. As such, **these do not work
well, if your router is in a different room**. Soon there will likely be a dongle o
you can use alongside them to essentially sidestep this issue, but even that
will require a custom build of the server, custom firmware, and of course, the
dongle itself. Once these are available, I'd generally recommend selling dongles
alongside the trackers.

Secondly, because the parts are decently different from the standard ones, there
might be small bugs that happen to them. Likely nothing deal breaking, but
it's good to be prepared for this.

## Producing Tiny-Slimes at scale

If you sell more than a handful of these trackers, I'd urge you to invest into
the hot plate and solder paste method. Not only will this make the process of
putting together the slimes themselves easier and faster, but it will also be
much more reliable than poking around with an iron.

## Attribution

Absolutely nothing forces you to attribute me. You can very well just go into
design files, delete the QR code and my logo and slap your own in place of them.
This is however what I'd refer to as a "d\*ck move". For the sake of staying on
friendly terms, I'd ask you to please keep my logo and the QR code in place. If
you want to put your own on there, there's plenty of free space to do so.
